# MyAnkiConfig

Custom modifications for Anki focused on fast editing and preserving formatting during study workflows.

## Features

* Paste strictly what you copied (no formatting loss, no background stripping).
* Flags remapped to `Alt + (number)` for easier access.
* Quick text coloring shortcuts to reduce editor friction.

## Text Color Shortcuts

* `Ctrl + 1` → <span style="color:#ffaa00;"><b>Orange (#ffaa00)</b></span>
* `Ctrl + 2` → <span style="color:#65cb96;"><b>Green (#65cb96)</b></span>
* `Ctrl + 3` → <span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Red (#ff0000)</b></span>
* `Ctrl + 4` → <span style="color:#ffffff; background-color:#444;"><b>White (#ffffff)</b></span>

The first three colors are automatically applied with **bold** to improve visual scanning while reviewing.

## Purpose

This setup removes unnecessary editor friction when creating or editing cards, allowing high–speed annotation without repeatedly opening formatting menus.

Designed for heavy daily use where small time losses compound into real inefficiency.
